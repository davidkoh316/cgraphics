Hello, I was unable to have a completely working project in the end,<br>
and it was to the point where my code did not display anything. <br>
However, my code does compile. <br>
I had to manually print EVERYTHING to make sure functions were working <br>
since I couldn't see anything. <br>
I had very big issues with rayGroup.todo.cpp and rayScene.todo.cpp,<br>
so I recommend checking to see where my issues were there. <br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some samples that I had displaying: <br>
